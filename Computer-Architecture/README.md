## üîß Exercises  

### **Exercise 1: LED Control with PIC16F628A**  
Circuit: LEDs connected to RB0, RB1, RB2, and RB3 terminals.  

#### Tasks:  
- **[a]** Turn on all LEDs.  
- **[b]** Toggle all LEDs every 1 second.  
- **[c]** LEDs on for 1 second, off for 500ms.  
- **[d]** Turn on LEDs from RB0 to RB3 with a 500ms delay between each.  
- **[e]** Same as [d], but turn off LEDs from RB3 to RB0 after all are on, repeating indefinitely.  

---

### **Exercise 2: Button and LED Interaction**  
Circuit: Button on RB0, LEDs on RB1 and RB2.  

#### Tasks:  
- **[a]** Turn on both LEDs when the button is pressed.  
- **[b]** Toggle LEDs on/off with button presses.  
- **[c]** Sequence: Turn on RB1 ‚Üí RB2 ‚Üí Turn off RB1 ‚Üí Turn off RB2.  
- **[d]** Same as [c], but with RB0 interrupt handling.  

---

### **Exercise 3: Button and Display Interaction**  
Circuit: Button on RB0, display connected to RB1-RB7.  

#### Tasks:  
- **[a]** Count from 0 to 15 in hexadecimal on button press. Reset after 15.  
- **[b]** Same as [a], but count down to 0 after reaching 15. Repeat indefinitely.  
- **[c]** Automatic counting with a 1-second delay between numbers. Use Timer 0 and RB0 interrupt. Pause/resume with the button.

## üõ†Ô∏è How to Use  

### **Development Environment**  
1. Install MPLAB IDE for assembly programming.  
2. Use Proteus for circuit simulation and testing.  
3. Refer to the PIC16F84A datasheet for Timer 0 configuration.  

### **Testing Programs**  
- Simulate circuits in Proteus before deploying to hardware.  
- Debug using MPLAB's built-in tools.

## üìú Methodology  

- **Step-by-Step Approach**: Break down each exercise into smaller tasks.  
- **Modular Design**: Separate logic for input handling, calculations, and output display.  
- **Error Handling**: Ensure robustness by handling edge cases (e.g., overflow, invalid inputs).

## ‚ö†Ô∏è Critical Note  
Always validate Timer 0 configurations and interrupt handling to ensure precise timing and responsiveness!
