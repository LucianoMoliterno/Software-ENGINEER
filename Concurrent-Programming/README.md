# Concurrent Programming üöÄ  
[![Python](https://img.shields.io/badge/Python-Concurrent_Programming-blue)](https://www.python.org/)  
**Repository for learning and applying concepts of concurrent programming, including threads, processes, and distributed systems.**

---

## üìö Core Topics  

### **Basic Concepts of Concurrent Programming**  
- **Sequential Programming vs Concurrent Programming**: Differences in execution models and use cases.  
- **Need for Concurrent Programming**: Advantages in performance, scalability, and resource utilization.  
- **Problems in Concurrent Programming**: Race conditions, deadlocks, and synchronization challenges.  
- **Finite State Machine**: Modeling system states and transitions in concurrent systems.  

---

### **Concurrent Programming in Distributed Environments**  

#### **Key Concepts**  
- **Transaction Concept**: Logical units of work that ensure consistency.  
- **Atomic Transactions**: All-or-nothing execution to maintain data integrity.  
- **Granularity**: Level of detail in transaction management (e.g., row-level vs table-level).  
- **Isolation**: Ensuring transactions do not interfere with each other.  
- **Commit and Rollback**: Finalizing or undoing transactions based on success or failure.  
- **Invariant Operations in Databases**: Maintaining constraints during transactions.  
- **Idempotence Condition**: Ensuring repeated execution does not alter outcomes.  
- **Locks and Deadlocks**: Mechanisms for resource control and resolving contention.  
- **Logs and Checkpoints**: Techniques for recovery and fault tolerance.  

#### **Tasks**  
- **Python (Execution Threads)**: Hands-on exercises using Python's threading module.

### **Processes**  

#### **Key Concepts**  
- **Process Concept**: Definition and role of processes in operating systems.  
- **Structure**: Components of a process (e.g., code, stack, heap).  
- **Life Cycle and States**:  
  - New, Ready, Running, Waiting, Terminated.  
- **Scheduling**: Algorithms for efficient CPU utilization.

## üîë Key Resources  

### **Tools & Libraries**  
- **Python**: `threading`, `multiprocessing` modules for concurrent programming.  
- **Distributed Systems**: Concepts applied to databases and cloud environments.  

### **Examples & Exercises**  
- **Thread Synchronization**: Using locks, semaphores, and condition variables.  
- **Deadlock Prevention**: Strategies like resource ordering and timeouts.  
- **Transaction Management**: Simulating commit/rollback in Python.

## üõ†Ô∏è How to Use  

### **Study the Theory**  
1. Open `/theory/concurrent_programming_basics.md` for foundational concepts.  
2. Review `/theory/distributed_transactions.md` for advanced topics.  

### **Practice with Examples**  
1. Solve threading exercises in `/exercises/python_threads`.  
2. Experiment with process scheduling in `/exercises/process_lifecycle`.  

### **Simulate Distributed Systems**  
- Use `/tools/transaction_simulator.py` to test atomicity and isolation.

## üìú Methodology  

- **Step-by-Step Learning**: Start with basic concurrency concepts and progress to distributed systems.  
- **Hands-On Practice**: Real-world examples and datasets for practical understanding.  
- **Visualization**: Use diagrams and logs to analyze thread/process behavior.
