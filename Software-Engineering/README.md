## üõ†Ô∏è How to Use  

### **Study the Theory**  
1. Open `/theory/lifecycle_models.md` for an overview of software lifecycles.  
2. Review `/theory/agile_methodologies.md` for Agile frameworks.  

### **Practice with Examples**  
1. Solve practical exercises in `/exercises/use_case_points`.  
2. Experiment with project planning tools like PERT and Gantt in `/tools/project_management`.  

### **Submit Deliverables**  
- Follow the structure provided in `/templates/deliverable_report_template.md` for reports.

## üìú Methodology  

- **Step-by-Step Learning**: Start with foundational concepts (lifecycles, requirements) and progress to advanced topics (metrics, quality management).  
- **Hands-On Practice**: Real-world examples and datasets for practical understanding.  
- **Collaborative Work**: Group tasks to encourage teamwork and problem-solving.
