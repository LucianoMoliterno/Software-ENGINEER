## 🍫 Annual Project: Chocolate E-Commerce Cost Analysis  
### 📋 Objective  
Develop a logistics optimization system for a chocolate distributor to minimize shipping costs under these constraints:  
- **Package Weight**: 500g to 2kg.  
- **Distance**: 400–600 km.  
- **Delivery Time**: ≤48 hours.  

### 🔍 Methodology  
1. **Data Collection**: Tariff research from 3+ carriers (e.g., Argentinian Post, Andreani).  
2. **Mathematical Modeling**:  
   - Linear cost functions: `Cost = Base Fee + (Distance × km Rate) + (Weight × kg Rate)`.  
   - Comparative tables and GeoGebra visualizations.  
3. **Software Implementation**:  
   - Interactive menu system.  
   - Cost calculation engine.  
   - Scalable architecture for future product lines.
