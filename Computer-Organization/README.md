     - Textbooks like *Computer Organization and Design* by Patterson & Hennessy.  
     - Manufacturer whitepapers (e.g., Intel, AMD, Samsung).  
   - Validate all sources with teaching staff or academic advisors.  

2. **Structure Design**  
   Example index:  
   - **Introduction**: Overview of computer organization and its importance.  
   - **Abstraction Layers**: From hardware to high-level software.  
   - **Networks**: Physical layer to protocol stacks.  
   - **Hardware**: Transistors, logic gates, and CPU microarchitecture.  
   - **Memory Technologies**: Cache optimization, RAM advancements, and storage evolution.  
   - **System Software**: Firmware, kernel design, and device driver interactions.  
   - **Conclusion**: Summary of interrelations and future trends.  

3. **Writing Standards**  
   - Adhere to faculty formatting guidelines (e.g., APA, MLA, or ISO citations).  
   - Include in-text citations and a detailed reference list.  
   - Use diagrams, tables, and flowcharts to enhance clarity.
