[![CLIPS](https://img.shields.io/badge/CLIPS-Rule_Based_Reasoning-red)](https://www.clipsrules.net/)  
**Repository for knowledge engineering concepts and a product recommendation expert system using CLIPS.**

---

### Knowledge Engineering Workflow  
1. **Knowledge Acquisition**  
   - Interview protocols, domain expert collaboration.  
2. **Conceptualization**  
   - Entity-Relationship diagrams, decision trees.  
3. **Formalization**  
   - Rule templates (IF-THEN), semantic networks.  
4. **Validation & Verification**  
   - Consistency checks, test case scenarios.  

### Technical Components  
- **CLIPS Implementation**: Rule-based reasoning engine.  
- **Knowledge Base Design**: Modular hierarchies for scalability.  
- **Feasibility Testing**: Coverage analysis via CAV/PER tables.

## üõí Semester Project: Product Recommendation Expert System  

### Objective  
Develop a CLIPS-based advisor for electronics purchases (laptops/phones) that:  
- Guides users through preference-based questions.  
- Recommends optimal devices using 20+ weighted rules.  
- Generates traceable decision paths for transparency.

### Key Deliverables  

#### 1. **CAV Tables**  
| Condition         | Action               | Validation Test       |  
|--------------------|----------------------|-----------------------|  
| Budget < $500     | Filter budget-tier   | Price threshold check |  
| Usage = "gaming"  | Recommend GPUs       | GPU-intensive devices |  

#### 2. **PER Tables**  
| Performance Metric | Efficiency Score | Reliability % |  
|---------------------|------------------|---------------|  
| RAM ‚â• 8GB          | 92%              | 89%           |  
| Storage ‚â• 512GB    | 88%              | 91%           |  

#### 3. **Hierarchical Task Diagram**  
```bash
[User Input] ‚Üí [Need Analysis] ‚Üí [Device Filtering]  
                ‚Ü≥ [Budget Check]  
                ‚Ü≥ [Usage Pattern Detection]
```

## üîë Implementation Strategy

### Knowledge Base Design

#### 1. Product Ontology
```bash
(deftemplate device  
  (slot id)  
  (slot type) ; "laptop"|"phone"  
  (slot price)  
  (multislot features)) ; "gaming", "portable"
```
#### 2. Inference Rules
```bash
(defrule recommend-gaming-device  
  (usage "gaming")  
  (budget >= 1000)  
  =>  
  (assert (recommendation "GPU-intensive devices")))
```

### Validation Workflow

#### 1. Static Checks
- Rule conflict detection to ensure consistency.
   
#### 2. Dynamic Tests
```bash
Test Case 3:  
Input: {"budget": 800, "usage": "design"}  
Expected Output: MacBook Air/M1
```
