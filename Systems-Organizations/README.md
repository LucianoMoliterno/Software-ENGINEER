## 🌟 Core Content  

### **I. Theoretical Foundations**  

1. **General Systems Theory (GST)**  
   - Meta-systems & subsystems  
   - Key properties: Entropy, homeostasis, synergy  
   - Classification: Open/Closed, Deterministic/Stochastic  

2. **System Semantics**  
   - Conceptual modeling  
   - Common issues: Coupling, redundancy  

---

### **II. Strategic Systems**  

3. **Organizational Management**  
   - Value chain (Porter's model)  
   - Market segmentation  

4. **Information Systems**  
   - Supply Chain Management (SCM)  
   - Customer Relationship Management (CRM)  
   - Business Intelligence (BI)  

---

### **III. Technical Components**  

5. **Intelligent Systems**  
   - Expert systems  
   - Case-based reasoning  
   - AI-driven management  

6. **Support Systems**  
   - Data/model-driven Decision Support Systems (DSS)  
   - Hybrid systems

## 🔑 Key Resources  

### **Models & Diagrams**  

- **Flowchart Templates**:  
  1. Purchase process → Segmentation → CRM analysis  

#### **System Classification Matrix**:  
| Criterion       | Example                          |  
|-----------------|----------------------------------|  
| Complexity      | Expert system vs DSS             |  
| Purpose         | Strategic vs Tactical            |  

- **Hybrid DSS Workflow**:  
  Data → Predictive model → User interface → Decision  

- **Organizational AI Cycle**:  
  Data → Learning → Inference → Action → Feedback  

---

## 🛠️ Methodology  

- **Systemic Analysis**:  
  - Identify subsystems and their interactions.  

- **Strategic Design**:  
  - Align SCM/CRM with organizational goals.  

- **Evaluation**:  
  - Use BI metrics for optimization.
