## 💻 Key Projects  

### 🎥 **Movie Theater System Project**  
**Objective**: ADT-based system with 3+ interconnected structures using void stacks/queues.  
- **C1 Requirements**:  
  - Interactive menu for stack/queue operations  
  - File persistence (.txt or MySQL)  
  - Example: Queue of customers + stack of purchases per customer  
- **C2 Requirements**:  
  - Integration of binary tree (void*)  
  - Enhanced menu for multi-structure management  

### 🏢 **Branch Management System Project**  
**Objective**: C++ program for company branch analytics.  
- **Features**:  
  - Dynamic array/struct implementation (max 25 branches)  
  - Zone-based revenue reporting (N/S/E/W/Center)  
  - Min/max revenue detection  
  - Input validation (ID: 100-999)

## 🛠️ Tools & Workflow
- **Development**: Code::Blocks (C/C++)
- **Persistence**:
  - Basic: Text files (fstream)
  - Advanced: MySQL integration (optional)

- **Validation**: Valgrind for memory leaks

---

## 🔑 Key Features
- **TDA/ADT Implementation**: Reusable void* structures
- **Exam Solutions**: 2022-2025 finals/partials with O(n) analysis
- **Industry-Grade Patterns**: Memory-efficient C++ structs
